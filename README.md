## Using my configuration

If you want use this configuration follow the steps

### Clone 

The first step is clone this repository at 

`~/.config/`

Command `git clone git@github.com:daltondiaz/init.lua.git nvim`

If you already have a nvim folder a good option is rename `mv nvim nvim_bk`
so you wouldn't lose your old configuration.

### Rename folders

You'll find some folder with my name so you can use them because of course is a 
wonderfull name or you can rename to your name/alias

### Packer

Now inside `lua/dalton`(or your name/alies of last step) open `nvim packer.lua`
and type `:PackerSync` if don't work use this command first `:so` to source your 
file.

### End
